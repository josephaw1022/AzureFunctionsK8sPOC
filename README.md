# Azure Functions with Kubernetes and KEDA: A Quickstart Guide

This repository provides a quickstart guide on how to deploy an Azure Function locally within a Kubernetes cluster using Docker and KEDA. The aim is to demonstrate a simple proof of concept, showing how an Azure Function can be scaled based on the results of our keda scalers. This one being the results of a sql server query.

## Overview

- **Azure Function with Docker**: The Azure Function in this repository is containerized using Docker, making it easy to run without needing additional installations.
  
- **Skaffold**: With just the `skaffold run` command, you can build, run, and deploy the app to a local Kubernetes cluster.
  
- **KEDA with SQL Server Trigger**: The scaling in this demonstration is based on a SQL Server trigger. The number of pods for our deployment will change based on the values we manually adjust in a specific database.

## Setup Instructions

1. **External Docker Network**:
    - If you haven't already, create an external network using:
      ```
      docker network create local
      ```
    - This setup allows for future CI/CD integrations with Docker-in-Docker, ensuring images are pushed to the registry only after certain tests pass.

2. **Local Docker Registry**:
    - Start the local Docker registry:
      ```
      docker compose -f k8s/registry/docker-compose.yaml up -d
      ```

3. **Docker Image**:
    - Build and push the Docker image:
      ```
      docker compose build --push
      ```

4. **SQL Server with Helm**:
    - We've provided a Helm chart for SQL Server exposed via a headless service.
    - Set up the namespace and install the chart:
      ```
      kubectl create namespace az-local-functions-db
      helm install sql-server-release sql-server-chart -n az-local-functions-db
      ```
    - To upgrade the chart later:
      ```
      helm upgrade sql-server-release sql-server-chart -n az-local-functions-db
      ```

5. **Database Setup**:
    - Forward the headless port using Rancher Desktop.
    - Manually access the SQL Server using tools like SSMS or Azure Data Studio.
    - Create a database named "az-sql-server-db" and execute the following SQL script to create the required table:
      ```sql
      SET ANSI_NULLS ON
      GO
      SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
      GO
      
      IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.tables WHERE name = 'keda-scaler-poc' AND schema_id = SCHEMA_ID('dbo'))
      BEGIN
          CREATE TABLE [dbo].[keda-scaler-poc](
              [name] [nvarchar](255) NULL,
              [scale] [int] NULL
          ) ON [PRIMARY]
      END
      GO

      ```

6. **Deploying the App with Skaffold**:
    - Use Skaffold to manage image building and Helm deployments:
      ```
      skaffold run
      ```
    - The Dockerfile for the Azure Function app can contain one or more functions. Here's a snapshot of the Dockerfile:
      ```Dockerfile
        # Use the .NET 7 SDK as the base image
        FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS build-env
        WORKDIR /app

        # Copy and restore the project
        COPY *.csproj ./
        RUN dotnet restore

        # Copy the rest of the app and build
        COPY . ./
        RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out

        # Use the Azure Functions .NET base image
        FROM mcr.microsoft.com/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated:4-dotnet-isolated7.0-slim AS runtime
        ENV AzureWebJobsScriptRoot=/home/site/wwwroot
        WORKDIR /home/site/wwwroot
        COPY --from=build-env /app/out .
      ```
    - Use `skaffold deploy` to perform the Helm release.
    - For continuous development, `skaffold dev` will trigger `skaffold run` every time there's a change to the Azure Function.

Happy coding and deploying!
